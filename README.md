Everytime I start a new socket application, I always start with Beej's examples (found here:
http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/). Once I have the basics, I add in sendall, rewrite the receive
routine to get all of the input into one buffer as well as so some cleaning. I've started to
replace some of the code with C++ in the hopes to eventually convert it into OO. Instead of 
doing this for the 1,000th time, I am comitting it here. Feel free to make impovements 
specifically around readability, performance and ease of use.

Enjoy
